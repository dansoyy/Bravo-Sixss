            Hi! my name is Christian Reblando and I'm 19 years old. I live in Cabuyao City, Laguna, at Southvile 
            1, Marinig. I am the oldest brother of three siblings. Now Im in 2nd year college in Pamantasan ng Cabuyao. 
            My personality qualities is Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Judging , as well as myself. I am a people-
            oriented person who enjoys participating in our social community. My accomplishments are governed by firm values, 
            and I am happy to offer advice to others. I'm Supportive and outgoing person, I can always be spotted at a party – 
            I'm the ones finding time to chat and laugh with everyone! But my devotion goes further than just breezing through 
            because I have to. And I'm truly enjoy hearing about their friends’ relationships and activities, remembering little 
            details and always standing ready to talk things out with warmth and sensitivity. If things aren’t going right, or 
            there’s tension in the room, i always pick up on it and to try to restore harmony and stability to the group.Being 
            pretty conflict-averse, I always spend a lot of their energy establishing social order, and prefer plans and organized 
            events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers. Coming to terms with my sensitivity biggest challenge – 
            people are going to disagree and they’re going to criticize, and while it hurts, it’s just a part of life. I thought 
            the best thing for me is to do what they do best: be a role model, take care of what they have the power to take care of, 
            and enjoy that so many people do appreciate the efforts i made.
